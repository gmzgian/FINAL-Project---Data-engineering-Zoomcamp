# Worldwide Labour Force Project - End to end data pipeline
My final project of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp consisted in developing an End-to-end data pipeline that fetches, transforms and analyzes worldwide labour force data.

Through this pipeline, data is extracted from the website and undergoes a series of carefully orchestrated processes, such as uploading to the cloud, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, to provide users with accurate and up-to-date statistics on labor issues across the world. With its comprehensive data collection and streamlined data processing, the end-to-end data pipeline taking data from the offical ILOSTAT website https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/ exemplifies the power of technology to drive social and economic progress.
